<p>Hello {{email_greeting_identifier}},</p>

<p>
  {{courier_name}} tried to deliver your package from {{merchant_name}} today but the driver was unable to complete it.
</p>

<p>
  Your delivery driver should have left a card with details on how to re-schedule your delivery, or the location where your package can be collected.
</p>

<p>
  If you can’t find your card, please contact the carrier directly quoting the details below:

    Carrier: {{courier_name}}
    <br/>
    Carrier Phone Number: {{courier_contact_destination}}
    <br/>
    Carrier Tracking Number: {{carrier_shipment_reference}}
  <strong>
</p>

<p>
  {{courier_name}} will hold onto your package for 5 business days. If re-delivery or collection is not arranged by then, your package will be returned to {{merchant_name}}.
